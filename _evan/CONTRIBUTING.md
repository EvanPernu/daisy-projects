# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing :) Pull requests are welcome.

Before merging:
* Update `_evan/<project_name>/CHANGELOG.md` according to [Keep a Changelog's format](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
* Update the `VERSION` variable in `_evan/<project_name>/<project name>.cpp`.
* Add a copy of `_evan/<project_name>/build/<project name>.bin` to `old_builds` and rename it like so: `<project name>_1-0-0.bin`.

As you can probably tell, I'm pretty new to C++, embedded, and Daisy. I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism or advice on my code :)
