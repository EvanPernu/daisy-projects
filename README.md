# Evan's Daisy Projects :smile:

This is a fork of Daisy_Examples containing all of my own projects, which are in the `_evan` directory.

For instructions on how to build any of my projects, check the `README.md` file in `_evan/<project_name>`

For more info, check out [the official Daisy examples repo](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples).

As you can probably tell, I'm pretty new to C++, embedded, and Daisy. I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism or advice on my code :)
